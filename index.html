   <div class="skill-section">
  <div class="skill-header" onclick="toggleSkill(this)">Notable Contributions</div>
  <div class="skill-content">
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented permission-level design for single user centric function controls and ADO DB seed scripting to ensure accurate and secure user provisioning.</li>
      <li>Developed address-level automation logic, facilitating dynamic assignment of officers based on hierarchical structures within geographic domains, improving operational efficiency.</li>
      <li>Enabled automation feasibility for .ZIP and PDF file validation, making it possible to automate core functionalities such as letter correspondence workflows and Crystal Reports generation, resulting in improved test coverage and streamlined regression testing.</li>
      <li>Implemented dynamic key-pair test data resolution using token-based scripting (e.g., <code>{LoginUsername}</code> or <code>Login.Password</code>) in a scalable Selenium + SpecFlow + C# framework. Designed a runtime parser to fetch environment-specific values from .resx files, ensuring clean separation of test logic and data and enhancing test reusability and maintainability.</li>
      <li>Implemented a WebElement wrapper class to standardize interactions with common UI elements such as dropdowns, buttons, and input fields. Included built-in waits, exception handling to improve test stability, reduce code duplication, and simplify step definitions.</li>
      <li>Implemented a strategy to centralize explicit waits by creating reusable wait helper methods (e.g., <code>GetWebElementSelector</code>) and using them at the page class level instead of directly in step definitions. Handled dynamic elements, AJAX calls, and loaders through intelligent wait conditions. Followed best practices by defining private locator variables within page classes to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.</li>
